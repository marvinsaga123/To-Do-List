# To-Do-List

Simple To Do List appliation for iOS that allows the user to add items that need to be done and remove them as they are completed. Consists
of a two view structure, with one displaying the current list and one displaying the functionality to add new items to that list. Handles
error checking for incorrect input and does not allow duplicate items (case sensitive) to be added to the to-do list.
